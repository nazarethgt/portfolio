                <div class="semblanza">
                    <h1>Hi, I'm Nazareth </h1>
                    <h2>but my friends use to call me Naza</h2>
                    <h2>I'm a developer, creator, and problem solver with excess of logic and curiosity</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I've been building things ever since the day I designed a blueprint in technical
                    drawing for the first time. Logical thinking and technology have always fascinated me, and I've
                    never been
                    afraid to explore new tools, whether it's Paint, canvas, AutoCAD, or CSS.
                </p>

                <p> Throughout my life, I've worked in various professional fields, from structural calculations and
                    budget development to the execution of digital advertising campaigns, be it search or performance.
                    Marketing led me to something more, and here I am, immersed in the world of programming.
                </p>


                <p> What excites me the most about working in software development is the ability to design and create
                    things that have a purpose and solve real problems. Relying on research and customer knowledge,
                    identifying the right problems to solve, learning from them, delivering that value as quickly as
                    possible, and then iterating to improve that value over time is the key to great design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of my favorite quotes from Peter Drucker is, "There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently
                    that which should not be done at all." This resonates deeply with me because I have no desire to do
                    things just for the
                    sake of it. I simply want to do, design, or build ideas and products that matter and have a positive
                    impact on people's lives.
